I really want to find more movies like this.  What do I mean by atmospheric? I mean one of the dir\\'s primary goals was to establish a \"mood\" or \"feeling\" even to a fault (eg, \"Tree of Life\" focuses on atmosphere perhaps to the extent that it detracts from being coherent).  What do I mean by visually beautiful? Lots of movies are good-looking, but I like movies where the *primary* goal was to look visually amazing - where every shot is perfectly designed (eg, \"Tron Legacy\" is a fantasy example of this, \"The Master\" is a real world example of this).  What do I mean by \"features OST prominently\" or \"soundtrack at forefront\"? Well, I guess, first I prefer atmospheric soundtracks. Eg, \"Magnolia\" might be well-integrated brilliantly with its OST (think of when the characters all start singing the Aimee Mann song as if in a music video). And eg, \"Almost Famous\" (Tiny Dancer scene). But I\\'m looking more for OSTs that are \"atmospheric\" if that makes any sense - \"atmospheric\" meaning the OST propels the mood of the scene without stumbling into the limelight. Think of \"Tron Legacy,\" \"Lost in Translation,\" \"Traffic,\" \"The Fountain,\" \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"Drive,\" etc.  I know this is all kind of vague, but I think of other people have the same preferences they\\'ll know *exactly* what I\\'m talking about and hopefully be able to recommend similar movies.

I\\'d like to experience another \"Lost in Translation\", and while I know that it\\'s almost generic to request movies of loneliness, I\\'d like to specify my taste:  the reason LiT works so well for me is primarily because of the setting. Tokyo is just the perfect urban hyper-modern surrounding for isolation, where everybody is part of a great big mass and protagonists (like the 2 americans in the movie) with their inner strugglings find themselves confronted with reflection. the idea of isolation in a flashing setting is just wonderful. A city that is as repulsive as it is enchanting, and the shoe-gazing soundtrack also couldn\\'t have been chosen better.  this wasn\\'t supposed to be a LiT-praise thread, but a rather accurate description of my request!

The films had to be ones which I had never seen before and so I began to compile a list. But it wasn't quite interesting enough. It was failing to entice me. Then I had an idea: every week of that year would categorized into a specific theme, no week quite the same as the last, always keeping things interesting, always giving myself a new genre or actor or idea to become immersed in.   The list below is the result of much refinement and revision. A little under two years, I'd wager. I am now asking reddit to help me refine the list a little more. There are a few weeks I'm unsure about, like Twist Endings Week (what's the point if I know every film will have a twist ending?). And a few weeks may have a few obvious, glaring omissions; movies I probably haven't included because I've already seen them. Take a look and tell me what you think.

You get the idea. Unless the trope is used in a innovative, brilliant way.  I've given some examples below, with spoilers for the movie:  Pontypool **[SPOILERS]**: A zombie virus that is transmitted by words.  Triangle **[SPOILERS]**: Being stuck in an infinite time loop.

       " '[NSFW?] Can you recommend an enjoyable, sexy or erotic movie for my girlfriend and I? Hi!   I also posted the same question regarding TV-shows on a different subreddit.   To the question: My long time girlfriend has a lot of intimacy issues we\\'re working out. Our next step is trying to be more sexual. We like to watch movies during the weekends, where comedy (almost every kind) is our favorite, but we would like to watch something with more sexual content. The reason why we would like the sexual content, is to think more about sex - both as to get a reminder and hopefully to get a bit aroused.   We don\\'t like fantasy movies with magic, sword combat, orcs and dragons or any kind of Sci-Fi at all. She loved the Twilight movies and books, so vampire stuff works. Negative kind of sexual content is also a HUGE NO-NO - like rape, molestation or even someone clearly getting pressured into something. Comedies are preffered, but almost every genre works. We would like to avoid very sad movies, unless they are really worth watching.  The more sexual content, the better. It doesn\\'t have to be grafic, but seeing some skin and sex scenes wouldn\\'t exactly be a bad thing. The acting and plot should at least be watchable as in terms of quality. A bad direct-to-DVD movie with the only intention to show some nipples, isn\\'t exactly the thing we\\'re looking for. Although \"high school comedies\" is something my GF enjoys, so we\\'re not that picky. We\\'re not looking for Oscar winners, we want to get entertained and get it the mood at the same time.  Softcore porn is still porn, but we are definitely open for erotic *insert genre here*. We thoroughly enjoyed watching \"The Voyeur\", as the plot and story was enjoyable. We would however liked the movie more if it was in english.   Do you redditors know of anything we might enjoy, which also get us (her) in the mood?  TLDR:  Please recommend an entertaining, sexy or erotic, non sci-fi/fantasy movie, my GF and I would enjoy. Requirements: - \"Decent\" movie and actors  - Not a Sci-Fi or fantasy movie - No negative kind of sexual content (rape, molesation, abuse)  EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your recommendations.

I'm also a huge fan of Roman Polanski films (Repulsion is one of my favorites) and P.T. Anderson... movies with crazy endings that just leave you completely mind-fucked (sorry if I'm not allowed to curse here!)  3. I watch a lot of anime as well &amp; I want to find some movies similar to Paprika &amp; Akira (Berserk is one of my favorite anime, btw).  so I'm looking for some movies that are similar to Black Mirror, Ex Machina, &amp; Transcendence as well as any movie that leaves you completely freaked out or messes with your head, you know?!  any suggestions?! thanks in advance!\",\n",

I find this disappointing.  A few that have actually scared my while watching are Thirteen Ghosts (this was when I was much younger actually), White Noise, and the first half of Insidious.

Monsters are in a very iffy category and need to be truly horrifying to get me.

I really want him to enjoy it so that maybe he will be inclined to watch more with me.  He has stated that he is not interested in possession movies, but the other parameters I have set up are just fine. He\\'s also said that it\\'s difficult for him to find a movie scary if he doesn\\'t like the characters. The less annoying they are, the better. He\\'s also not a fan of convoluted plots, so something simple is best.  **EDIT**: Forgot to add, he hates unnecessary gore...  Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

      "[REQUEST] Atmospheric, visually beautiful movies w/ soundtrack at forefront (eg, \"Drive,\" \"Lost in Translation,\" \"Solaris,\" \"The Fountain,\" \"Tron Legacy,\" \"Thin Red Line\") I'm really into movies that are atmospheric, visually beautiful, and which feature the soundtrack prominently. I really want to find more movies like this.<br/><br/>What do I mean by atmospheric? I mean one of the dir's primary goals was to establish a \"mood\" or \"feeling\" even to a fault (eg, \"Tree of Life\" focuses on atmosphere perhaps to the extent that it detracts from being coherent).<br/><br/>What do I mean by visually beautiful? Lots of movies are good-looking, but I like movies where the *primary* goal was to look visually amazing - where every shot is perfectly designed (eg, \"Tron Legacy\" is a fantasy example of this, \"The Master\" is a real world example of this).<br/><br/>What do I mean by \"features OST prominently\" or \"soundtrack at forefront\"? Well, I guess, first I prefer atmospheric soundtracks. Eg, \"Magnolia\" might be well-integrated brilliantly with its OST (think of when the characters all start singing the Aimee Mann song as if in a music video). And eg, \"Almost Famous\" (Tiny Dancer scene). But I'm looking more for OSTs that are \"atmospheric\" if that makes any sense - \"atmospheric\" meaning the OST propels the mood of the scene without stumbling into the limelight. Think of \"Tron Legacy,\" \"Lost in Translation,\" \"Traffic,\" \"The Fountain,\" \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"Drive,\" etc.<br/><br/>I know this is all kind of vague, but I think of other people have the same preferences they'll know *exactly* what I'm talking about and hopefully be able to recommend similar movies.

Here is quote from wikipedia that gives a summary of what epic films are:<br/><br/>&gt; An epic film is an epic genre that emphasizes human drama on a grand scale. Epics are more ambitious in scope than other film genres, and their ambitious nature helps to differentiate them from similar genres such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films often take a historical or imagined event, or a mythic, legendary, or heroic figure and add an extravagant, spectacular setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars, making them among the most expensive of films to produce.\n",

      "365 Days of Film Hello, good people of r/MovieSuggestions. A couple of years ago I had an idea to watch one film every day for one year. The films had to be ones which I had never seen before and so I began to compile a list. But it wasn't quite interesting enough. It was failing to entice me. Then I had an idea: every week of that year would categorized into a specific theme, no week quite the same as the last, always keeping things interesting, always giving myself a new genre or actor or idea to become immersed in. <br/><br/>The list below is the result of much refinement and revision. A little under two years, I'd wager. I am now asking reddit to help me refine the list a little more. There are a few weeks I'm unsure about, like Twist Endings Week (what's the point if I know every film will have a twist ending?). And a few weeks may have a few obvious, glaring omissions; movies I probably haven't included because I've already seen them. Take a look and tell me what you think.

      "[Request] Movies like Pacific Rim. I really liked how humanity really seemed to be on the brink of destruction. The fight against the Kaiju felt utterly hopeless at times. You see these larger than life Jaegars and think there's no way anything can take them down until you watch as one is brutally torn apart, the pilots totally helpless. And no matter what, the Kaiju keep coming, more and more frequently. <br/><br/>I'm looking for movies that share a similar feeling of despair and hopelessness.

      "Misleading movies like Shutter Island, Side Effects, and The Game. My wife and I love a particular kind of psychological thriller. These movies are usually pretty bleak. The characters are typically unreliable narrators. The common theme is that the viewer is lead to believe one thng is going on, and everything is consistent with that plot, but then there is a particular kind of twist that recasts the whole movie in a new light.<br/>Shutter Island, Side Effects, and The Game are good examples of this type of twist ending.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?<br/><br/>EDIT - Damn, you guys are awesome.<br/>I've got a dozen suggestions I haven't seen yet. That should keep us busy for a few days. <br/>Keep them coming if you know of any other great films. Thanks!\n",

I like the idea of a movie that's conceptually scary and then delivers with good execution of direction/production/acting/etc.<br/><br/>It's rare that a movie actually scares me. The last really scary movie I saw was The Strangers but the ending was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?\n",

I'd like a movie like Wanted or Fight Club that takes a normal, bored guy and shows him another way to live. Wanted was a bit cheesy at times, but I enjoyed the premise. Of course, fight club was excellent. <br/><br/>Now, along with the movie request, I'd like to ask if you think these types of films actually induce change. Are they helpful in thinking differently about the way one can live their life?<br/><br/><br/>Obviously the discussion isn't required, but i'd love to get some feedback.\n",

      "[REQUEST] A \"I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you here today\" movie. I just got done watching [Sexy Evil Genius](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1801096/) with Seth Green, and I loved it. It was basically a group of people summoned to a bar by a common ex without knowing each other. Awesome revenge flick. <br/><br/>So I am basically looking for a movie with a similar feel: Strangers meeting each other brought together for a mysterious reason. Kind of like a [\"And Then There Were None\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None) vibe.\n",

      "[Request][NSFW?] Can you recommend an enjoyable, sexy or erotic movie for my girlfriend and I? Hi! <br/><br/>I also posted the same question regarding TV-shows on a different subreddit. <br/><br/>To the question:<br/>My long time girlfriend has a lot of intimacy issues we're working out. Our next step is trying to be more sexual. We like to watch movies during the weekends, where comedy (almost every kind) is our favorite, but we would like to watch something with more sexual content. The reason why we would like the sexual content, is to think more about sex - both as to get a reminder and hopefully to get a bit aroused. <br/><br/>We don't like fantasy movies with magic, sword combat, orcs and dragons or any kind of Sci-Fi at all. She loved the Twilight movies and books, so vampire stuff works. Negative kind of sexual content is also a HUGE NO-NO - like rape, molestation or even someone clearly getting pressured into something. Comedies are preffered, but almost every genre works. We would like to avoid very sad movies, unless they are really worth watching.<br/><br/>The more sexual content, the better. It doesn't have to be grafic, but seeing some skin and sex scenes wouldn't exactly be a bad thing. The acting and plot should at least be watchable as in terms of quality. A bad direct-to-DVD movie with the only intention to show some nipples, isn't exactly the thing we're looking for. Although \"high school comedies\" is something my GF enjoys, so we're not that picky. We're not looking for Oscar winners, we want to get entertained and get it the mood at the same time.<br/><br/>Softcore porn is still porn, but we are definitely open for erotic *insert genre here*. We thoroughly enjoyed watching \"The Voyeur\", as the plot and story was enjoyable. We would however liked the movie more if it was in english.<br/><br/><br/>Do you redditors know of anything we might enjoy, which also get us (her) in the mood?<br/><br/>TLDR: <br/>Please recommend an entertaining, sexy or erotic, non sci-fi/fantasy movie, my GF and I would enjoy.<br/>Requirements:<br/>- \"Decent\" movie and actors <br/>- Not a Sci-Fi or fantasy movie<br/>- No negative kind of sexual content (rape, molesation, abuse)<br/><br/>EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your recommendations. I really, really, REALLY appriciate it! All of your comments have been read, but not all were commented on, since there were so many. Thank you again!\n",
      "[REQUEST] Movies like Moneyball in terms of management/business. I watched it recently, I like it a lot. Specifically I liked how it didn't focus on baseball, and focused on the business behind it all. Similar to that would be The Social Network, both have Aaron Sorkin involved in the writing so I guess I like his writing style.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be specifically about sports, it's the aspect of managing or creating a specific thing that I like.\n",

I'm looking for German films to help my understanding and it would also be cool to see great foreign films at the same time. <br/><br/>I just watched [Gerard Richter Painting](http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70222624?trkid=2361637) which was a documentary I enjoyed thoroughly.

I've listed a few movies that I really like that come to mind below to maybe help get an idea of the style of film I'm into<br/><br/>* Boogie Nights<br/>* Punch-Drunk Love<br/>* The Royal Tenenbaums<br/>* Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy<br/>* No Country for Old Men<br/>* Mr. Nobody<br/><br/>**EDIT:** You guys are awesome! I now have more German films than I'll ever need. I can't wait to start watching these..

It was shot in black and white but I don't think it's all that old. I'm 99% sure that the movie was two words and the first word started with a \"B\". I'm about 60% sure that the directors were cult German brother-directors who've only done a few movies. <br/><br/>I think that the story was about a guy who went to some gentleman school or some sort of weird academy maybe? I remember it being super weird, but I really want to watch it haha.<br/><br/>I know that this sounds like it should be easy to search for, but I've seriously combed through all my messages online, my youtube history, and scoured Google.

In other words, a twist should change how the viewer sees the narrative.<br/><br/>Hopefully you'll suggest some interesting movies. Thanks :)\n",

      "Psychological Sci-fi movies? As strange as it sounds, I haven't finished a movie in like two years. Except Fight Club, that was amazing and probably my favourite movie ever. No matter what I try, most movies bore me after twenty minutes at most. So this is gonna be a weird request.<br/><br/>Those clichéd mainstream movies bore me to death, so instead of trying to watch what's new and hot, I wanna just try something that suits my taste. I love psychological stories, something that makes me question morality, decisions and views. Something that actually challenges the way I think about certain things. <br/><br/>And I love space. Space travel, exploration, the visuals - everything about it. Are there any movies that combine those two? Oh, and another important thing. If a movie has even the slightest of a jumpscare, I can't watch it. I'm dead serious. I'm cool with creepyness, but sudden loud noises and jumpscares in general just get to me way too much. So most of the horror genre already falls out.<br/><br/>Any suggestions for me? Actually, if you have a book in mind, I'd love to hear it too.<br/><br/>\n",

Some films comparable to what I am looking for are \"So Close\" and \"Hero\".<br/><br/>I've seen for example \"Fearless\" and \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" too, but they're not really what I'm looking for since those are really only about the action scenes. I like how \"So Close\" portrayed the relationship between the two sisters and \"Hero\" was just poetic, in a sense.<br/><br/>I know this might not make a whole lot of sense, but I hope I explained it well enough.<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually, they don't need to be asian.

I'd never liked the genre in the past (never had a bad experience with one, but something about bad acting and shitty plots always kept me from exploring the genre), but, of course, I really liked it, so now I'm looking for more. <br/><br/>My only requirement for a suggestion is that it needs to be at least partially well acted. The actors don't need to be Jack Nicholson, but bad acting can often pull me out of a film. Other then that though I'm up for anything, so bring them on! <br/><br/>\n",

      "[Request] Action movies that are so bad they're good I need help finding a movie for Easter.  We celebrate non-traditional Easter with some friends - we eat non-traditional foods (like ribs or dim sum) and watch a really terrible movie.  Examples of movies we've watched include Running Man (1987), Maximum Overdrive (1986), and Zardoz (1974).  <br/><br/>The theme is sort of action movies with a sci-fi bend, preferably from the 70s or 80s.  Movies that have really ridiculous one-liners are the best.  I'm trying to avoid things that are too mainstream in hopes of finding something we haven't all seen already.  <br/><br/>Ideally I'm looking for something on Netflix so I don't have to put in tons of effort tracking it down, but I'm assuming there are tons of options.  I'm just hoping someone can think of a recommendation for something along these lines that they found really entertaining.<br/><br/>*Edit - thanks for all the good bad suggestions.  You guys are great.  I have a huge list of options for many years to come, assuming I don't binge watch all of these immediately!<br/>\n",

      "Advice for a Movie Marathon?? I'm currently trying to figure out a marathon, probably 6 movies, to watch with my friends who aren't as big movie fans as all us nerds.

Sci-Fi fan, mystery, good drama, animation, documentaries and I like independent and foreign movies etc.<br/>The original Stalker movie and every Ingmar Bergmann movie was great in this respect.<br/><br/>But today I watched \"Song of the sea\", animation from Scotland. And though I am not a huge fan of children movies, I found it beautiful and very moving. It didn't feel Disney to me, and that's a good thing. I have seen many of the good animes from Japan ala Studio Ghibli and I found them equally nice. Ghost In The Shell is my favorite masterpiece of that anime genre and era. But it needs to be said that I enjoy real movies as well, and they don't have to movies either. They can be documentaries or just some people on youtube talking or trying to create something or tell a story. <br/><br/>I guess I am in that Donnie Darko mood as well, and I would enjoy watching something like that or some like the mentioned above. Animated or not is not important, as long as it has feelings.<br/><br/>I can throw some keywords out there that might help you in what I'm after: Melancholic, real, deep, somewhat magic, makes you think, dark but beautiful etc.<br/><br/>Thanks for anything.\n",

While for me the movie itself didn't -really- start until after he returns from the island, the feelings, the sentiment of what he went through after returning, what it would be like, the empathy it made me have from multiple points of view.

I also know defining a horror movies as good depends on a person's taste. So do you have a movie that can scare me enough to keep me from turning of the lights at night? Jump scares are cheap, but I will allow movies with it(hopefully not excessive but I did like *Grave Encounters*). I enjoy any horror-genre, from zombies to witches, monsters to killers. Just give me something that will scare me out of my shorts even during the day. These days, I'm looking for black magic/occult/witchcraft toned movies like *The Blair Witch Project*, it doesn't have to be found footage but I won't mind if it is(*Cloverfield* was fun). I love ghosts, the unexplained, concepts in horror movies that relate closely to real life.<br/><br/>***<br/>To give you an idea of what I like and don't like(in no particular order):<br/><br/>#Likes<br/>- *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*<br/>- *Let the Right One In*<br/>- *Insidious*<br/>- *28 Days Later*<br/>- *Night of the Living Dead*(Original and remake)<br/>- *Dawn of the Dead*(2004)<br/>- *The Silence of the Lambs* - One of the few psychological ~~thrillers~~ horrors I really like<br/>- *The Cabin in the Woods*<br/>- *Pet Sematary*<br/>- *The Ring*(2002) - First half of the movie was so much fun.<br/>- *The Blair Witch Project*<br/>- *Shutter*(2004)<br/>- *As Above, So Below*<br/>- *Jeepers Creepers*<br/>- *Devil*<br/>- *REC*<br/>- *A Tale of Two Sisters*<br/>- *The Eye*(2002)<br/>- *Martyrs*<br/>- *It Follows*<br/>- *The Others*<br/>- *The Descent*<br/><br/>#Dislikes; Movies usually suggested in this sub.<br/>- *The Shining* - Sue me. It was slow, yes it is a classic but the movie is so over-hyped as horror. It's a psychological thriller.<br/>- *The Exorcist* - Not scary. The Devil did not seem to possess(heh) any kind of real threat.<br/>- *Event Horizon*<br/>- *Trick 'r Treat*<br/>- *The Orphanage*<br/>- *Session 9*<br/>- *The Babadook* - It was obviously made to have a weird ass name for easy searching.

It makes the whole movie really relatable. Can you recommend some good dramas made using that concept? To give you some examples of what I want - I really enjoyed [Tyrannosaur (2011)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204340/?ref_=nv_sr_2) and, to some extent, [This Is England (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480025/).<br/><br/>The movies don't have to be British.

However, I do find it difficult to find a movie that legitimately scares me *while* watching it. It's usually late at night, long after the movie is over that I feel it's effects. I find this disappointing.<br/><br/>A few that have actually scared my while watching are Thirteen Ghosts (this was when I was much younger actually), White Noise, and the first half of Insidious.<br/><br/>I find ghosts and demons the most terrifying, while \"real life\" things such as serial killers not threatening at all. Monsters are in a very iffy category and need to be truly horrifying to get me.<br/><br/>My SO would really like to watch a scary movie with me, but I don't want it to be one that is not only boring, but also terrible as a movie in itself. I really want him to enjoy it so that maybe he will be inclined to watch more with me.<br/><br/>He has stated that he is not interested in possession movies, but the other parameters I have set up are just fine.

      "Surreal movies with lengthy shots of unnerving or interesting visuals (like the shots of flowing/bubbling liquid in Eraserhead) I watched Eraserhead the other night and I want more movies like it. I want seemingly disjointed, weird visuals and disturbing practical effects. I love the shot when Henri stabs the baby and that goo just flows out of its guts and completely envelops it. I asked a movie buff friend and he recommended me some good movies that are similarly \"weird\", but not in the same vein I'm looking for.<br/><br/>I just really like weird, surreal movies with lengthy visual shots, especially if there's little to no dialogue. Other movies I like in this same vein are Koyaanisqatsi and, to a certain extent, It's Such A Beautiful Day (I like the lengthy shot where he is just watching the rain from the bus as the music continually swells and recedes.)

So cool.<br/><br/>I love stuff which twists your mind to has you think in different ways. My fondest example was Requiem for a Dream, probably near to top for some of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Movies with similar exploration of concepts: Her (The points in which she becomes more and more human, eventually transcending human flaws and integrating into the hivemind), Exam ( The suspense and thought provokation of figuring out the rules and who will actually escape ), Cloud Atlas (a pretty good example of exploration of time as a whole all around), and What Dreams May Come (The concept of life after death). <br/><br/>Others which I respect but didn't fully enjoy: Mr Nobody.<br/><br/>There's one other major one I'm forgetting, but I'd love things which explore concepts beyond our preception, or simply excellent at working your mind to combine the story. <br/><br/>That being said - Anything related to Cop-drama can be left out, such as Se7en.<br/><br/>Edit: The Truman Show is actually another great more lighthearted concept I also enjoyed.\n",

      "Optimistic Science Fiction I'm trying to create a list of sci-fi movies that are optimistic about science and technology to (re-) watch over the next couple of weeks, ones where the aliens *aren't* out to get us.<br/><br/>Something in the same vein as<br/><br/>* The Martian<br/>* Interstellar<br/>* Contact<br/>* (Some of) Star Trek<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if they are modern movies or from the 1920s, animated or live-action - as long as they're optimistic about technology and science.<br/><br/>E.g. Interstellar might look bleak, but they're solving their problems with space travel. On the opposite end there is Independence Day which feels optimistic because the whole planet comes together, but here we're attacked by evil aliens and their superior technology (except for the mediocre IT security).<br/>\n",

      "Slow-paced, beautifully-shot, contemplative films Preference for movies post-2000 (I like the visual crispness and detail of more recent movies), and *international*/non-english films. I really like movies that aren't driven by some contrived or unusual plot, but rather more simple ones centered around human relationships or other more universal subjects. I appreciate sparseness, thoughtfulness, and visual beauty. <br/><br/>Some examples of ones I like:<br/><br/>* Winter Sleep (2014) - watching this right now actually and it sparked this post. A perfect example. <br/><br/>* A Separation (2011)<br/><br/>* Blue is the Warmest Color (2013) - my all-time favorite film<br/><br/>* Amour (2012)<br/><br/>* Hana-bi (1996)\n",

Maybe as a kid, or just a broke adult.

Also, notably, they all sort of revolve around drugs, mobsters, the 80's, and partying.

Movies I saw suggested by someone on a whim, or someone who was browsing through iTunes and was like 'That sounds interesting, hey sundance!' ones that aren't too mainstream, but have gained traction from being actually good instead of just counterculture or attempting to be jarringly new for the sake of being new. Not to say it doesn't have it's place, but I love films like these. Primer is a good example of a borderline movie for this, though I did really enjoy it! It was pretty rough to follow at times.<br/><br/>While I adore film, it's not something I can fully immerse myself into but maybe once or month. I know there's a ton of sites which document every movement of every possible film, I'd rather have a 'Here's the highlights of the month you should watch!' <br/><br/>That being said. I'm in that type of moood. What are some excellent under the radar / indie films from this year / last year you guys think deserve more attention for being excellent, even if it's only in highlights.

I really liked the movie for the way it portrayed investigative journalism; and in a way where not everyone is always working actively against the protagonist. It was refreshing to see a movie where the bosses at the paper wasn't trying to sabotage the investigation or something like that. So often I feel like movies in this sort of vein, with the protagonists trying to uncover a mystery/scandal, ends up manufacturing tension and drama because everyone has a hidden agenda and the characters have to fight their battles within and not just outside - so to speak. Everyone was on the same team, as they rightly should be, and I really liked that. It really showcased the work rather than the events.

      "Films with strong female lead--but flawed This is a tough one. I've seen many strong female lead characters like Rear Window's Lisa, Hunger Games' Katniss, Mary Poppins, Alien's Ellen, Clarice Starling, etc. However what i'm searching for is flawed women that are not perfect, messy, could be morally ambiguous and not necessarily nice/likable. Sort of an anti-heroine but not necessarily. Also, please exclude non-lead character love-interests like most of film noir's femme fatale.<br/><br/>Examples of what i'm looking for: Elle - Elle (2016), Norma Desmond - Sunset Blvd., Amy Dunne - Gone Girl, Lisbeth Salander - TGWTDT, Margaret Thatcher - The Iron Lady, Scarlett O'Hara - Gone With the Wind, Eve and Margo - All About Eve, etc.<br/><br/>Thank you!\n",
      "Zombie movies that don't skip the initial apocalypse Anything like the first 20 minutes of World War Z.\n",

      "50 State Movie Tour I'm an NYC area super commuter with a lotta free train time on my hands that I usually spend watching movies. I thought it would be a cool idea to watch a movie set in every US state over the next few months. <br/><br/>I'm looking for movies predominantly set in one state, so no road trip flicks. And I'd count *Fargo* as a Minnesota movie for example. <br/><br/>So any suggestions welcome, especially from the Delawares of the country. Thanks!\n",
      "Movies about urban life, crime, youth being corrupted by gangs etc. I'm looking for dark movies set in big US cities, possibly involving violence, gangs, drugs, family problems, struggle with life, growing up in bad environment and trying to get free and earn a normal life.<br/><br/><br/>I really liked the Tv Show The Wire, the movie Fruitvale Station. I love Kendrick Lamar's album good kid maad city. I' looking for that kind of atmosphere. The hardship of urban life. Possibly involving black people. I'm looking for similar things. Thanks.\n",
      "High school/college student films Hi guys, I'm looking for films that fit the category above. Films like American Pie and Everybody wants Some!! Is the type of films I mean. If you could give me some films like these to watch that would be great! Thanks.\n",

      "Looking for 80's and 90's movies to re-watch So... I have seen an abundance of movies, at least 1500+ I would say. So far I have managed to list 1250 movies and shows on imdb.com and those were only the ones I could remember ( I did not add them in 1 sitting though). <br/><br/>So the thing is there are a lot of 80's and 90's movies I feel I perhaps should re-watch seeing as I might have been too young to understand them fully.<br/><br/>What I am asking for You guys is if You could mention some movies from that era that You think You need to be an adult to fully comprehend.  So no need to mention Die Hard or The Police Academy or other more straightforward movies.\n",
      "Looking for good movies with a female soldier-type protagonist Something in the vein of Rambo would be ideal.<br/><br/>I'm *not* looking for a movie with a female sidekick or damsel in distress. She should be the main character. The tougher, the better.\n",
      "Movies with a mentally handicapped protagonist I had recently watched Like stars on Earth, as well as X+Y, and I enjoy both of them, and I was wondering if there are movies similar to this sort of plot?\n",
      "Movies like The Big Lebowski or The Matrix, where the main character is trying to learn more about a conspiracy. Sorry for the absolutely terrible phrasing, but I couldn't think of a better way to say it.\n",

      "[Request] Weird, quirky and not mainstream movies. I'm looking for movies that are little different than your average movie. Something similar to [The Last Circus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1572491/?ref_=nv_sr_1),[Who can kill a child](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075462/?ref_=nv_sr_1) and [Miss Violence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3078242/?ref_=nv_sr_1).<br/><br/>Genre doesn't matter and neither does the country of origin. So please give me suggestions.\n",
      "Movies with language barriers between the main characters or groups involved? Examples I've loved:<br/><br/> [Silent Night](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338434/?ref_=nv_sr_3)<br/><br/> [Into the White](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1876277/?ref_=nv_sr_1)<br/><br/> [Enemy Mine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089092/?ref_=nv_sr_1)<br/><br/>[Rush Hour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120812/?ref_=nv_sr_1) fits, too - so it doesn't have to be war related. <br/><br/>I also loved the scene in Saving Private Ryan where they have the POW and are discussing whether or not to let him live while he begs for his life, mediated through their translator. If there are movies including moments with tense translation like that, I'll try them out; it just helps if it's the entire premise. <br/><br/>Bonus points if it's between strangers or enemies, like the first three mentioned above.\n",
      "Movies about thieves? Preferably involving pickpockets. It doesn't have to be the complete focus of the movie. I really enjoyed Focus, Now You See Me (1 and 2), and Bastille Day (renamed The Take).\n",
      "Movies with snowstorms. For the winter time (No Christmas stuff) Something like 'The Hateful 8'.<br/>I like the 'cottage feeling'.\n",

      "Looking for something I can watch with my boyfriend... We both have somewhat different tastes and find it so difficult to pick out movies we can both agree on. I'm just going to give a run down on our typical tastes, and hopefully you guys have some good recommendations. Thank you. :)<br/><br/>I tend to watch movies he thinks are artsy fartsy and boring, for example: Antichrist. I've gotten him to like a few of these \"artsy\" films. He actually really enjoyed The Lobster and Swiss Army Man recently. I enjoy horror and it's my favorite genre. I am a very avid movie watcher so I constantly look out for \"different\" movies and really appreciate out of the box movies, if only for creativity. I also like really goofy movies, like Shaun of the Dead and Tucker and Dale VS Evil, which he can only get into 50% of the time. <br/><br/>He on the other hand LOVES war movies and bad action films with 0 plot. I try to watch them, but I just really don't like war movies unless they rip out your soul and produce copious amounts of tears (see The Pianist). I can dig a good action movie, but I need plot and human emotion involved. The Green Room was an action movie we both enjoyed. <br/><br/>PS We both like anime, but he's pretty new to it. I've got him to watch Gurren Lagann, Hayao Miyazaki movies and Parasyte so far and he's enjoyed all immensely.\n",

      "Just saw Eyes Wide Shut. I want more movies about people getting involved with fucked up cults involving powerful people. \n",
      "I love grandly done, Historical Dramas, that make the most of location and really commit to the work behind creating the feel of a particular time and place. Sorry if that's a bit long winded. But I'm really into art direction, set design and costume in film. <br/><br/>Stuff I'm looking for would be like:<br/><br/>-The Last Emperor<br/><br/>-Cleopatra<br/><br/>-Waterloo<br/><br/>-The Name of the Rose<br/><br/>*stuff I'm looking to avoid would be something 300, or Gods and Kings, creatively charged and certainly full of merit but more focused on the flash and spectacle of the story than portraying a world.*<br/>\n",
      "Any movie similar to \"Interstellar\" and \"The Martian\"? basically any cool space sci-fi movies, thanks in advance!\n",
      "Looking for movies where most of stuff happens at night and in a big city I'm interested in movies (preferably drama), where most of screen time filmed big city in the night. <br/>Maybe something like Taxi Driver (1976) or Nightcrawler (2014).<br/>Would be grateful to see any suggestions.\n",
      "I'm looking for movies with a radio dj in a MAIN ROLE. See description for more info. \"Main role\" is key. Otherwise I'd simply use the tag feature at Imdb.<br/><br/>Any genre is okay. <br/><br/>Three examples came to mind...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&gt; [Pontypool (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A psychological thriller in which a deadly virus infects a small Ontario town. <br/><br/>I recommended it to anybody. It's basically a zombie movie but it's a very clever one. And \"zombie movie\" and \"clever\" aren't exactly two things you commonly see in the same sentence.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&gt; [Love Serenade (1996)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116930/)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In Sunray, a backwater town on Australia's Murray River, there's little to do but fish or listen to the local radio station. D.J. Ken Sherry arrives from the hustle of Brisbane...<br/><br/>I recommended it to anybody. It's a great surreal comedy.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&gt; [Fog (1980)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080749/)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Legend says that Antonio Bay was built in 1880 with blood money obtained from shipwrecked lepers, which no one believes. On the eve of the town's centennial, many plan to attend the celebrations, including the murdered lepers.<br/>Director: John Carpenter<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  Writers: John Carpenter<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  Stars: Adrienne Barbeau<br/><br/>It's a great mainstream horror movie.\n",
      "Movies that have realistic and suspenseful combat like in Sicaro and Zero Dark thirty? \n",
      "Horror movies like You're Next, where the protagonist is not scared at all! Can be a paranormal movie as long as protagonist is strong! by strong, I mean completely fearless!\n",
      "Movies where the characters are trapped/ in peril? Hi,<br/><br/>I was looking for films similar to ATM, Devil, Frozen etc where characters are in a situation and have to figure a way out of it. I guess this could even be extended to Jaws style movies too where they may be being stalked by something.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks\n",
      "Movies where they fuck with the wrong person/people. I'm looking for movies of both kinds.<br/><br/>Ones like John Wick, Man on Fire, Taken for example, where the main character is not to be fucked with and something happens that forces them to jump in to action. Any type of genre, but I really like Horror movies done in this nature. You're Next for example, and I'm dying to find some more like this.<br/><br/>Also, ones like the recent Don't Breathe or Green Room where the main characters fuck with the wrong people/person and have to deal with the consequences/fight back etc.<br/><br/>Thanks guys. I'm desperate for some more films like this. Don't know what it is, but I love films like this a lot.\n",
      "Please please recommend me some laugh out loud movies. FROM start to finish. Please understand what I am saying, NOT movies that make me smile, but, laugh uncontrollably. I am depressed. Help Minimum drama. Minimum(or no) romance. But, LOL from start to finish.<br/><br/><br/>I will tell you about a movie I did laugh until I started crying.

      "I'm looking for sad films that explore sexual awakening. A lot of my favorite films are love stories that share a common theme that begins with a character with much to learn about themselves mentally, emotionally, and sexually (such as Blue Is The Warmest Color, Brokeback Mountain, and The Notebook). In these examples, the lead is often introduced to a different lifestyle where, as a result, and with some struggle, they find themselves.<br/><br/>What are some other films that fit this theme?\n",
      "What are some movies that are like Inception, Interstellar or Arrival? \n",
      "Non-Cheesy Romance Films I love a good romance film or book, but I find a lot of them can be a little too unrealistic and cheesy. When a love story can be told without those elements, it's something I really enjoy. I think it is sometimes to hard to portray certain romantic moments without being cheesy, so I'll permit a little bit of cheese, so to speak. I realize this is all really subjective but I'd still love to hear what all of you have to recommend. <br/><br/>IMO, some examples that fit this description are: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Giant Mechanical Man... I can't think of any others right now.\n",

Once in a while people come here on this sub looking for mindfuck movies in the same style, I've watched a few and I have some recommendations! <br/><br/>I can't give a synopsis, these movies you have to go in without reading about it, but I can guarantee you can binge watch all of them because they have the same style/genre. <br/><br/>- [**Coherence**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) - It's a cliche in this sub already, but it's really good! <br/><br/>- [**Primer**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) - A little hard to follow, but it is definitely worth it.<br/><br/>- [**Time Lapse**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2669336/?ref_=tt_rec_tti) - This one's a little easier, but still it sets a nice mood.<br/><br/>- [**Man from Earth**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) - I think this is one of the most different ones here, but one of my favorites, if you like a dialogue-driven movie. <br/><br/>- [**Source Code**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) - One of the most \"mainstreams\" movies from the list, if you want a movie with more production, famous actors, etc.<br/><br/>- [**Timecrimes**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) - I love the filmography in this one, it's a little bit creepier than the other ones, but still very enjoyable.\n",

I really hope I can accurately describe what I mean, because it's more a feeling than anything else, so here I go.  <br/>  <br/>I'm looking for movies that have a similar vibe to these movies:  <br/>  <br/>- Being John Malkovich  <br/>- The Game  <br/>- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  <br/>- The Box  <br/>- The Lobster  <br/>- Truman Show  <br/>- Her  <br/>  <br/>What these have in common for me is that they feel weirdly realistic and unrealistic at the same time. They are set in the world we all now - but somehow it's not the world that we know because it has some weird rules that the film still just takes as a given, as if they were normal.  <br/>  <br/>I think Being John Malkovich is the best example of what I'm looking for (have seen all Charlie Kaufman movies by the way). The world looks just like ours. The people look just like we do. But they all behave in such strange ways, like people would never act in real life. But in the context of the film it all makes sense.  <br/>  <br/>I really don't know how to describe it, because that's what I'm looking for. Movies that make it hard to put your finger on what it is that makes them so uncanny.\n",

I really dig practical effects, cool monster/creature design, and movies with a strong aesthetic to them. I like dark fantasy and horror-fantasy, but I'm not necessarily looking for that here - but I'll gladly accept that kind of suggestion! <br/><br/><br/>Basically I just want suggestions for interesting fantasy films that will make me feel how Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story made me feel as a kid!

With just Craig and Smokey hanging out, talking. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I love Friday so much is it's so easy to watch no matter what mood I'm in, and never fails to cheer me up or pass the time easily.<br/><br/>Thanks guys :) I've been on such a Horror craze lately, that I want to watch some other chill shit for a bit lol.\n",

It's not really manipulation, but John Doe is in control and the police are always one step behind (at least). <br/><br/>Other movies that fit what I'm looking for: Cruel Intentions, The Usual Suspects, Disclosure (not sure about this one, I've forgotten almost all of it)<br/><br/><br/>I'm positive I'm forgetting a bunch of movies I've already seen, but I'm thankful for every suggestion!<br/><br/>edit: Thanks for all the answers so far!\n",

Maybe that's the case in Lord of the Rings and other fantasy movies, but as far as I know this is never explored because it's the audience is on the side of good and evil is doing what it's doing just for the sake of being evil. <br/><br/>I'm open to movies where it's not clear who the bad guys are, for example because both sides are committing crimes, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for.

      "Movies set in a ever-so-slightly different world? An odd request, but I've happened across a few of these and they've managed to become favorites. I'm thinking things like TiMER, District 9 and The Invention of Lying where the world has just a single, fundamentally unrealistic change that affects the whole dynamic of the world and creates a type of drama that could only occur in such a setting.<br/><br/>In TiMER, we all have a soulmate countdown clock that tells when you'll meet your perfect match. Some don't know because their match hasn't installed the timer, some won't meet theirs for a decade or more, and this knowledge gives everyone a unique perspective and attitude. In Invention of Lying, nobody has ever been able to lie, until one man suddenly becomes able, thus creating all manner of problems that are utterly hilarious and entertaining, but could only be possible in this kind of setting. District 9 is a film set as if it was in the real world, but alien life is not only confirmed, but widely known, accepted and treated in a very racist/xenophobic manner, complete with a bunch of hapless bureaucrats who check in on them like they were just casual parole officers. <br/><br/>It's an odd and kind of specific request, but I'd love to see more in this charming sub-genre. I hope I've explained what I'm looking for well enough, because it's a hard thing to quantify, but hopefully there are some people here who know what I'm talking about and also know some great indie/under-the-radar stuff that I've missed.\n",

      "Movies that are actually thought-provoking and surprising, that don't give away the ending? I'm sick of generic (mostly action) movies where the ending is painfully obvious within the first half hour of the movie; I just stop giving a shit when I know how it's going to end anyways. I'll list of some examples of movies I've really liked because they were thought-provoking or unpredictable, and I'll list some examples of movies that I just couldn't stand, that I want to steer away from. <br/><br/>**Movies that I really enjoyed**:<br/><br/>* *Inception (2010)* - Yes, you could argue that the ending was obvious the whole time, you kind of knew that their mission was going to succeed in the end, but there was SO much more that was being unraveled and revealed along the way.<br/><br/>* *Interstellar (2014)* - Absolutely amazing, I loved how it was presented. I had zero idea how it was going to end the whole way through.<br/><br/>* *The Sixth Sense (1999)* - This one should go without saying. I never saw it coming.<br/><br/>* *Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)* - Amazing soundtrack the whole way through, hilarious, and I had no idea what direction it would take next, the whole way through.<br/><br/>* *The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)* - Now again, with this one, you could TECHNICALLY make the argument that you know how it's going to end during a lot of the movie. But the way time jumps around, and not knowing what else will happen, kind of makes that irrelevant in the case of this movie.<br/><br/>* *The Hateful Eight (2015)* - Probably the best example I can think of. I legitimately wish I could wipe my memory of this movie, just so I could enjoy seeing it for the first time again, and being surprised and delighted by all the twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.<br/><br/>**Movies I couldn't stand, for context**:<br/><br/>* *Dredd (2012)* - I thought the concept was great, and had a lot of potential. But then as soon as they got locked inside the \"city\" and the crime boss announced that everyone would be hunting them, I knew how it was going to end. They'd run around aimlessly, have a few close calls, a few miraculous escapes, and then somehow, against all odds, defeat the big boss and make their escape. I turned it off after 10 minutes of that.<br/><br/>* *John Wick (2014)* - I found this to be about as unoriginal as action movies can get. Going into the movie, you already know the entire thing is going to consist of this amazingly skilled killer running around the city, somehow overcoming everyone who's out to kill him, just to defeat the bad guy and save the day at the last minute. I think I quit watching this one within the first 20 minutes. <br/><br/>Anyways, I hope that's enough background on the kind of movie suggestions I'm looking for. I have a lot of downtime to fill at night, so I will probably be watching most, if not all, of your suggestions. Thanks in advance!\n",

I’ll take any genre, but I’d particularly like something more on the drama side, as most of what I have seen already have been comedies like Walk Hard and This is Spinal Tap. Thanks folks!\n",

      "Good disaster movies, natural disasters, epidemics etc. I definitely prefer large scale disasters, not so much the super suspenseful focus on individuals - the main characters always have some of that, but not every scene or anything. Detailed death scenes should be minimal as well, I'm a bit tentative about watching Outbreak because I've read there's a lot of that. Also anything with a bunch of scientists running around trying to save the world is a winner.<br/><br/>I've been loving movies like The Day After Tomorrow, The Core, Contagion and so on.. The Day After Tomorrow is one of my favourites at the moment with all those phenomenal disaster scenes, plus the characters are pretty lovable. <br/><br/>Any recommendations?\n",

      "Movies That Explore Broken People with Anger Issues So, I'm currently going through something in my life right now, and since I've known for a fact that movies have helped people overcome emotional obstacles in their life and helped them feel better about themselves, I was hoping someone could help me do the same here.<br/><br/>I recently lost some precious friends due to my outburst of anger. My temper has always been a problem of mine, and I've been feeling depressed about these friends over the past few days, feeling bad about myself. So I was hoping I could find some films about broken people who are flawed like me and see how they overcome their insecurities and anti-social nature to fit into society or whatever.<br/><br/>An example I could think of is **Young Adult** starring Charlize Theron. Yes, Mavis didn't technically resolve her issues with her highschool sweetheart by the end of the movie, but I think it still fits because there's just something affirming when you see a flawed character like that who doesn't change, as if the film is telling you it's normal for you to be as flawed as you are, because that's just how people are.<br/><br/>That said, I'll leave it to your discretion what kind of film you think would help me feel better about my anger issues and my trouble dealing with people. Movies about angry people dealing with those anger issues would be really appreciated, because most recommendations I searched online just led me to plots where the anger is merely a superficial personality of the main character rather than the central plot. **Punch-Drunk Love** seems to be another good example where the MC deals with his anger issues (I haven't watched it though, so I'm hoping you could inform me how relevant this movie is to the issue).<br/><br/>And no, please don't recommend me **Anger Management**. :P That movie doesn't take anger issues seriously.

I liked the movies 12 Angry Men, A Few Good Men, etc, very much and I am wondering if there are more films (foreign ones are just fine as well) that focus on the courtroom stuff. <br/><br/>Thanks in advance\n",
      "Feelgood romances I watched The Vow last night and then Dear John today. I know they're not the most intellectual films ever but I just want something romantic and it doesn't have to be completely feelgood the whole way through, but I'd like a film with some nice any moments. Romcoms would also be acceptable.<br/><br/>I've already seen The Notebook, He's just not that into you, The Ugly Truth, Love Actually, This Means War, She's out of my league, Along Came Polly, Notting Hill, Pretty Woman, 27 Dresses, 10 things I hate about you, My big fat greek wedding, The Proposal, and probably a lot more I can't remember right now.\n",
      "I'm looking for a movie with dark intelligent humor. I really like smart comedies with the humor being in the situation and not so much the text. <br/>I'm thinking movies like M*A*S*H and The Royal Tenenbaums.\n",
      "[REQUEST] Scary movies for a 10 year old. My daughter said that she was a \"scary\" movie to watch by herself tonight. While at a friend's house and WITHOUT my permission she seen the last Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween and that's what she asked for. That kind of slasher flick is not an option. <br/><br/>We settled on the Legend of Sleepy Hollow from the library. What else would you recommend? Anything on Netflix Instant?\n",
      "[Request] Your favorite horror comedies. I loved Tucker &amp; Dale, Lesbian Vampire Killers, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Zombieland. Any others of a similar vein?\n",
      "[Request] I am looking for genuinely good scary movies. Any suggestions are appreciated. To make myself more clear; I'm looking for something with an actual storyline, not a movie solely made to make people flinch with fear or disgust. Maybe something like The Shining. <br/>Thank you very much :)\n",
      "[Request] Movies where the protagonist dominates everyone else Noone can come close to being as good as they are. The more dominant and cocky the better. Movies similar to what I am looking for:<br/><br/>- Blood and Bone<br/>- Rambo<br/>- Taken<br/>- Equilibrium<br/>- The Bourne movies\n",
      "[Request] Movies like Sunshine, Event Horizon, Pandorum You know.. spaceships, space. Thanks.\n",
      "[Request] Movies like In Bruges It's hard for me to pinpoint what I'm attracted to in this movie. I love the humor, and the sleepy atmosphere. I can't really find anything similar, suggestions are welcome.\n",
      "[Request] Movies like American Beauty? \n",
      "[Request] A psychological Thriller in the vein of Se7en Feel free to venture out of this description, but I'd like something that is ideally a mystery, with a tinge of horror to it. <br/><br/>A broader request is any thriller you guys like. <br/><br/>Thanks!\n",
      "[Request] Movies about introverts I'm thinking like Ghost World or Lost in Translation.\n",
      "[Request] Comedies about unstable vigilantes Like [Taxi Driver](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/), but funny. I really enjoyed [Observe and Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197628/) and [Super](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/). Since this appears to be a thing now, are there any other movies like those two? Thanks!\n",
      "[Request] Good, scary film on Netflix Instant for a newcomer to the genre, not too heavy on gore The title really says it all. I'm in the mood for a scary movie from Netflix tonight, but don't know what is good or bad on the streaming list. <br/><br/>I'd prefer a film that doesn't rely too much on gore. For reference, I was fine with the silly violence of Kick-Ass, but winced my way through Reservoir Dogs and Drive's more brutal scenes. <br/><br/>I've already seen Insidious (meh, but pretty scary) and Let the Right One In (excellent, barely scary at all), do you guys have any other recommendations?\n",
      "Which movie has your ultimate \"training scene\"? I'm thinking of the famous training scenes from rocky or kill bill 2.  What is your favourite training scene?\n",
      "[request] Decent movies carried by B-list actors. Movies like The Trotsky, and Goon where the lead is played by an actor typically in secondary roles (in these cases Jay Baruchel and Sean William Scott respectively).  <br/>Bonus points for films where the actor is so good they are no longer considered B-list, like Bruce Willis in Die Hard.\n",
      "I freaking Loved Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, any movies like it? You know I usually get pissed off at love movies because they are kinda dumb. But this one, was fucking AMAZING! It seemed so much more realistic- its not all happy and stuff. Idk- like I could really connect to the main character, Joel. I imagine like that's what I'll be like when I'm older. Plus he met the girl on a train, that's been like my fantasy for such a long time.  <br/><br/>What I took from that movie is that the love is not like the fairy tale. Love kind of sucks but I it's worth pursuing and fighting for. The girl was really pretty too. <br/><br/>This was the first movie in a long time that I really enjoyed, anything else similar to it?\n",
      "[Request] movies about people going on killing sprees what are some movies like \"Natural Born Killers\", \"Devils Rejects\", and \"Badlands\"?\n",
      "[Request] What are some good dystopian movies? I'm looking for a movie with a theme set with some sort of dystopian theme. I'm not sure what to compare it too since I have't really watch many movies set in the future except Blade Runner, so throw out your best! Thanks!\n",
      "[REQUEST] Movies with unconventional narrative structures, (Memento, Adaptation) Nothing blows me away as the moment the structure of the movie clicks perfectly with the theme and plot.  That moment, if handled correctly, can be exponentially more orgasmic than a standard climax.  Nothing has ever come close to my golden two:<br/><br/>* MEMENTO: When Guy Pearce abuses his own short term memory loss to commit guiltless murder<br/>* ADAPTATION: When the movie descends into a mindless drug heist crime movie, complete with car chase and deus ex machina RIGHT after Kaufman enlists his twin brother's help in finishing his screenplay<br/><br/>Any Kaufman film is usually great at this.  Etneral Sunshine and Synedoche come to mind.  Nolan did a great job with Inception also.  Any recommendations outside those two? Thanks!\n",
      "[Request] Movies that take place in extremely cold climates.  Any recommendations?  I am hopelessly fascinated by the arctic north. I'm looking for some movies (or good documentaries) that take place in very cold climates.  Think northern Canada, Greenland, Northern Alaska, Siberia, Antarctica, etc.  It doesn't necessarily HAVE to be that far north (or south, in the case of Antarctica), as long as the extreme cold is an integral part of the story.  No real genre preference.. but drama, survival, and documentary are at the top of the list.<br/><br/>A few good ones off the top of my head:<br/><br/>- [The Snow Walker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337721/) (love everything about this movie)<br/><br/>- [Touching the Void](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379557/)<br/><br/>- [Encounters at the End of the World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093824/)\n",
      "Movies with rain. I ask because at the moment where I live it there has been torrential rain. Even weather forecasters say that there is no end in sight to these rainy outbursts, which are causing pretty severe flooding in some areas. Also I thought it might be a question that requires a bit more thought than 'Films like Moon' or whatever.<br/><br/>So. Films not just where there might be one affectationally rainy scene, but films where rain is a vital part of creating the atmosphere. I'm thinking films like Blade Runner in which the prejudicial smothering rain has a symbolic meaning. If you want, you could mention films where other kinds of weather are used to the same effect. Honestly I thought it might just be an interesting thing to discuss really.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for your time. :)\n",
      "[Request]Asian Films, Such as These. Would love to see more films like these. I tend not to watch older films such as Bruce Lee's films, as I enjoy more modern, stylised films, but feel free to suggest any you think are appropriate. <br/><br/>Also, I decided not to say Martial Arts films in the Title, as I think a few of these don't fit into that category.<br/><br/>[The Good, The Bad, The Weird](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901487/)<br/><br/>[Ip Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220719/)<br/><br/>[Ip Man 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386932/)<br/><br/>[Kung Fu Hustle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373074/)<br/><br/>[Kill Zone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478024/)<br/><br/>[Hero](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/)<br/><br/>[Hard Boiled](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104684/)<br/><br/>[House of Flying Daggers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385004/)<br/><br/>[Fearless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446059/)<br/><br/>[FlashPoint](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0992911/)<br/><br/>[Fist of Legend](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110200/)<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for reading, and any suggestions are greatly appreciated!<br/>\n",
      "[Request] Movies About/Depicting Penal Colonies Been on a kick watching films that depict/take place in penal colonies.  I've watched the following:<br/><br/>* Papillon<br/>* No Escape<br/>* Escape from New York<br/>* Escape from L.A.<br/>* Aliens 3<br/>* Children of Men and The Chronicles of Riddick, though only parts of each film have scenes depicting a penal colony<br/><br/>I was wondering if there are any not on the list you all would recommend.

      "[Request] Movies told from an uncommon perspective. Or, movies with a twist that completely changes the second watching. (spoilers within) *Message about spoilers:* I warn of spoilers because the examples I want to give, and for most of the suggestions I expect to see: just naming the film and knowing there's a big twist coming might spoil the movie for some. Personally, I don't mind spoilers in the least. So let loose.<br/><br/>Best examples I can think of are Sixth Sense, Memento, Fight Club, The Orphanage, and especially The Others. The Others blew me away when I realized the twist, and rewatching it was a completely fresh experience. It was a completely different movie the second time around, it became a ghost story told from the ghost's perspective.\n",

      "[Request] Movies set in small towns. I recently watched Super 8. I really liked it, but honestly, the parts I enjoyed the most were in the first half of the movie. A group of friends in their small town, sneaking out, going to each other's houses and other things. I don't know why, but I really like that in movies!<br/>I'm looking for movies about groups of friends - kids/teenagers, to be a bit more specific - just... In their small town. Dealing with larger things or even just normal teenage stuff (the latter is preferred actually).<br/>I realise this is quite a specific niche, kind of a subgenre of Coming-Of-Age, but I'd be greatful for anything anyone knows about!
