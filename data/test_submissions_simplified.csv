5egzb4,"Movies similar to Spotlight (2015). I really liked the movie for the way it portrayed investigative journalism; and in a way where not everyone is always working actively against the protagonist. It was refreshing to see a movie where the bosses at the paper wasn't trying to sabotage the investigation or something like that. So often I feel like movies in this sort of vein, with the protagonists trying to uncover a mystery/scandal, ends up manufacturing tension and drama because everyone has a hidden agenda and the characters have to fight their battles within and not just outside -  so to speak. Everyone was on the same team, as they rightly should be, and I really liked that. It really showcased the work rather than the events. Instead of getting bogged down by all the victims and the tragedy and stuff, it focused on journalists doing their jobs, and doing it well. <br/>  <br/> So anyways, recommend me some movies about journalists/detectives/whoever working on investigations like that.",Spotlight (2015/I),Spotlight (2015/I),,Drama,Drama,,,,,investigative|journalism|everyone|working|the|tension|and|on|journalists|detectives,investigative|journalism|everyone|working|the|tension|and|on|journalists|detectives,

670yjv,"Movies set in a ever- so- slightly different world? An odd request, but I've happened across a few of these and they've managed to become favorites. I'm thinking things like TiMER, District 9 and The Invention of Lying where the world has just a single, fundamentally unrealistic change that affects the whole dynamic of the world and creates a type of drama that could only occur in such a setting. <br/>  <br/> In TiMER, we all have a soulmate countdown clock that tells when you'll meet your perfect match. Some don't know because their match hasn't installed the timer, some won't meet theirs for a decade or more, and this knowledge gives everyone a unique perspective and attitude. In Invention of Lying, nobody has ever been able to lie, until one man suddenly becomes able, thus creating all manner of problems that are utterly hilarious and entertaining, but could only be possible in this kind of setting. District 9 is a film set as if it was in the real world, but alien life is not only confirmed, but widely known, accepted and treated in a very racist/xenophobic manner, complete with a bunch of hapless bureaucrats who check in on them like they were just casual parole officers.  <br/>  <br/> It's an odd and kind of specific request, but I'd love to see more in this charming sub- genre. I hope I've explained what I'm looking for well enough, because it's a hard thing to quantify, but hopefully there are some people here who know what I'm talking about and also know some great indie/under- the- radar stuff that I've missed.",The Invention of Lying (2009)|District 9 (2009)|TiMER (2009),The Invention of Lying (2009)|District 9 (2009)|TiMER (2009),,,,,,,,ever-so-slightly|different|world,ever-so-slightly|different|world,

I'm sick of generic (mostly action) movies where the ending is painfully obvious within the first half hour of the movie; I just stop giving a shit when I know how it's going to end anyways. I'll list of some examples of movies I've really liked because they were thought- provoking or unpredictable, and I'll list some examples of movies that I just couldn't stand, that I want to steer away from.  <br/>  <br/> **Movies that I really enjoyed**: <br/>  <br/> * *Inception (2010)* -  Yes, you could argue that the ending was obvious the whole time, you kind of knew that their mission was going to succeed in the end, but there was SO much more that was being unraveled and revealed along the way. <br/>  <br/> * *Interstellar (2014)* -  Absolutely amazing, I loved how it was presented. I had zero idea how it was going to end the whole way through. <br/>  <br/> * *The Sixth Sense (1999)* -  This one should go without saying. I never saw it coming. <br/>  <br/> * *Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)* -  Amazing soundtrack the whole way through, hilarious, and I had no idea what direction it would take next, the whole way through. <br/>  <br/> * *The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)* -  Now again, with this one, you could TECHNICALLY make the argument that you know how it's going to end during a lot of the movie. But the way time jumps around, and not knowing what else will happen, kind of makes that irrelevant in the case of this movie. <br/>  <br/> * *The Hateful Eight (2015)* -  Probably the best example I can think of. I legitimately wish I could wipe my memory of this movie, just so I could enjoy seeing it for the first time again, and being surprised and delighted by all the twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. <br/>  <br/> **Movies I couldn't stand, for context**: <br/>  <br/> * *Dredd (2012)* -  I thought the concept was great, and had a lot of potential. But then as soon as they got locked inside the ""city"" and the crime boss announced that everyone would be hunting them, I knew how it was going to end. They'd run around aimlessly, have a few close calls, a few miraculous escapes, and then somehow, against all odds, defeat the big boss and make their escape. I turned it off after 10 minutes of that. <br/>  <br/> * *John Wick (2014)* -  I found this to be about as unoriginal as action movies can get. Going into the movie, you already know the entire thing is going to consist of this amazingly skilled killer running around the city, somehow overcoming everyone who's out to kill him, just to defeat the bad guy and save the day at the last minute. I think I quit watching this one within the first 20 minutes.  <br/>  <br/> Anyways, I hope that's enough background on the kind of movie suggestions I'm looking for.

I can watch these movies any time I want and will never be bored. <br/>  <br/> Tier 2; Tron Legacy is amazing, the motorcycle scene in the beginning got me into motorcycles, and I want to get the same motorcycle one day, Interstellar, Pulp fiction also makes it onto this tier. <br/>  <br/> Tier 3; Both Alice in Wonderland films so far, The Matrix (first one), Indiana James, and Wonder Woman 2017, Original Star Trek TV show (yes I know it's not a movie but still), Almost all batman films (batman is my favorite superhero, and I love the riddler), Sin City, Oceans 11 <br/>  <br/> Tier 4; The Fate of the Furious, ET, Both Guardians of the Galaxy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Original Ghostbusters, The Godfather, Golden Eye, One of the original supermans,  <br/>  <br/> I added about 10 movies not on my original list, but the higher up on my list is more what I like, I also probably missed a few.

6kapt6,"Movies That Explore Broken People with Anger Issues So, I'm currently going through something in my life right now, and since I've known for a fact that movies have helped people overcome emotional obstacles in their life and helped them feel better about themselves, I was hoping someone could help me do the same here. <br/>  <br/> I recently lost some precious friends due to my outburst of anger. My temper has always been a problem of mine, and I've been feeling depressed about these friends over the past few days, feeling bad about myself. So I was hoping I could find some films about broken people who are flawed like me and see how they overcome their insecurities and anti- social nature to fit into society or whatever. <br/>  <br/> An example I could think of is **Young Adult** starring Charlize Theron. Yes, Mavis didn't technically resolve her issues with her highschool sweetheart by the end of the movie, but I think it still fits because there's just something affirming when you see a flawed character like that who doesn't change, as if the film is telling you it's normal for you to be as flawed as you are, because that's just how people are. <br/>  <br/> That said, I'll leave it to your discretion what kind of film you think would help me feel better about my anger issues and my trouble dealing with people. Movies about angry people dealing with those anger issues would be really appreciated, because most recommendations I searched online just led me to plots where the anger is merely a superficial personality of the main character rather than the central plot. **Punch- Drunk Love** seems to be another good example where the MC deals with his anger issues (I haven't watched it though, so I'm hoping you could inform me how relevant this movie is to the issue). <br/>  <br/> And no, please don't recommend me **Anger Management**. :P That movie doesn't take anger issues seriously.
