10tqw6;I'm looking for a thought provoking, dark, suspenseful movie.;I'm looking for a movie that really makes you think and takes you away from reality to where you're just thinking about how the movie is going to play out.

I loved Shutter Island because of the ending, so if you have any movies that have sort of an eerie feeling with suspense and a good plot to them would be awesome.

(Good movie, I really liked how fucked up everyone in this was. Definitely got me thinking about what it is to be a monster. Plus the whole cop off the rails thing is appealing.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Man from Nowhere    (I particularly liked Bin Won in this movie. His fighting was fantastic and the scene with the little girl at the end, tears man. Tears.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Raid Redemption  (I cannot explain how much I love this movie. I've seen it 4 times now. Gets my blood pumping every time. If you know of anything recent like this then please let me know. Great movie.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Battle Royale   (Bloody good fun)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A Bittersweet Life   (Nothing in this movie really stood out for me, but it was a good movie. I wish the relationships were explored more, but meh. I feel like they tried to add comedy in some scenes where there wasn't much to be had. The ending felt very lackluster too.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Any suggestions would be fantastic. I do prefer recent movies over older movies though, if it helps. ie: 2000+, '90s is pushing it for me. Hope you guys can help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Edit:* I've got a nice solid lineup of movies to check out.

1csb8n;"[REQUEST] Atmospheric, visually beautiful movies w/ soundtrack at forefront (eg, ""Drive,"" ""Lost in Translation,"" ""Solaris,"" ""The Fountain,"" ""Tron Legacy,"" ""Thin Red Line"")";"I'm really into movies that are atmospheric, visually beautiful, and which feature the soundtrack prominently. I really want to find more movies like this.<br/><br/>What do I mean by atmospheric? I mean one of the dir's primary goals was to establish a ""mood"" or ""feeling"" even to a fault (eg, ""Tree of Life"" focuses on atmosphere perhaps to the extent that it detracts from being coherent).<br/><br/>What do I mean by visually beautiful? Lots of movies are good-looking, but I like movies where the *primary* goal was to look visually amazing - where every shot is perfectly designed (eg, ""Tron Legacy"" is a fantasy example of this, ""The Master"" is a real world example of this).<br/><br/>What do I mean by ""features OST prominently"" or ""soundtrack at forefront""? Well, I guess, first I prefer atmospheric soundtracks. Eg, ""Magnolia"" might be well-integrated brilliantly with its OST (think of when the characters all start singing the Aimee Mann song as if in a music video). And eg, ""Almost Famous"" (Tiny Dancer scene). But I'm looking more for OSTs that are ""atmospheric"" if that makes any sense - ""atmospheric"" meaning the OST propels the mood of the scene without stumbling into the limelight. Think of ""Tron Legacy,"" ""Lost in Translation,"" ""Traffic,"" ""The Fountain,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Drive,"" etc.<br/><br/>I know this is all kind of vague, but I think of other people have the same preferences they'll know *exactly* what I'm talking about and hopefully be able to recommend similar movies.

Epics are more ambitious in scope than other film genres, and their ambitious nature helps to differentiate them from similar genres such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films often take a historical or imagined event, or a mythic, legendary, or heroic figure and add an extravagant, spectacular setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by a sweeping musical score, and an ensemble cast of bankable stars, making them among the most expensive of films to produce.";tt0099348|tt0104691|tt0110322|tt0172495;;epic;;;;;

Hence, I'll be hearing and reading about tons of classic films, with spoilers flying at me from every direction. I used to be very sensitive about spoilers, but I've made peace with them as it's impossible to study film without being able to openly discuss them, spoilers and all.<br/><br/>However, I'm going to try and quickly watch those movies that truly rely on an unspoiled viewpoint, á la *The Usual Suspects* and *The Sixth Sense*. My request is as follows: share with me the great modern classics (1960-now), the staples of modern cinema if you will, that I should try and watch before the inevitable spoiler comes around.

Tokyo is just the perfect urban hyper-modern surrounding for isolation, where everybody is part of a great big mass and protagonists (like the 2 americans in the movie) with their inner strugglings find themselves confronted with reflection. the idea of isolation in a flashing setting is just wonderful. A city that is as repulsive as it is enchanting, and the shoe-gazing soundtrack also couldn't have been chosen better.<br/><br/>this wasn't supposed to be a LiT-praise thread, but a rather accurate description of my request!

1n87wl;365 Days of Film;"Hello, good people of r/MovieSuggestions. A couple of years ago I had an idea to watch one film every day for one year. The films had to be ones which I had never seen before and so I began to compile a list. But it wasn't quite interesting enough. It was failing to entice me. Then I had an idea: every week of that year would categorized into a specific theme, no week quite the same as the last, always keeping things interesting, always giving myself a new genre or actor or idea to become immersed in. <br/><br/>The list below is the result of much refinement and revision. A little under two years, I'd wager. I am now asking reddit to help me refine the list a little more. There are a few weeks I'm unsure about, like Twist Endings Week (what's the point if I know every film will have a twist ending?). And a few weeks may have a few obvious, glaring omissions; movies I probably haven't included because I've already seen them. Take a look and tell me what you think.

23l6gq;[Request][NSFW?] Can you recommend an enjoyable, sexy or erotic movie for my girlfriend and I?;"Hi! <br/><br/>I also posted the same question regarding TV-shows on a different subreddit. <br/><br/>To the question:<br/>My long time girlfriend has a lot of intimacy issues we're working out. Our next step is trying to be more sexual. We like to watch movies during the weekends, where comedy (almost every kind) is our favorite, but we would like to watch something with more sexual content. The reason why we would like the sexual content, is to think more about sex - both as to get a reminder and hopefully to get a bit aroused. <br/><br/>We don't like fantasy movies with magic, sword combat, orcs and dragons or any kind of Sci-Fi at all. She loved the Twilight movies and books, so vampire stuff works. Negative kind of sexual content is also a HUGE NO-NO - like rape, molestation or even someone clearly getting pressured into something. Comedies are preffered, but almost every genre works. We would like to avoid very sad movies, unless they are really worth watching.<br/><br/>The more sexual content, the better. It doesn't have to be grafic, but seeing some skin and sex scenes wouldn't exactly be a bad thing. The acting and plot should at least be watchable as in terms of quality. A bad direct-to-DVD movie with the only intention to show some nipples, isn't exactly the thing we're looking for. Although ""high school comedies"" is something my GF enjoys, so we're not that picky. We're not looking for Oscar winners, we want to get entertained and get it the mood at the same time.<br/><br/>Softcore porn is still porn, but we are definitely open for erotic *insert genre here*. We thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Voyeur"", as the plot and story was enjoyable. We would however liked the movie more if it was in english.<br/><br/><br/>Do you redditors know of anything we might enjoy, which also get us (her) in the mood?<br/><br/>TLDR: <br/>Please recommend an entertaining, sexy or erotic, non sci-fi/fantasy movie, my GF and I would enjoy.<br/>Requirements:<br/>- ""Decent"" movie and actors <br/>- Not a Sci-Fi or fantasy movie<br/>- No negative kind of sexual content (rape, molesation, abuse)<br/><br/>EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your recommendations.

If I could request one last thing... <br/><br/>There was a weird avant-garde German film that I've forgotten the name of. It's driving me crazy. It was shot in black and white but I don't think it's all that old. I'm 99% sure that the movie was two words and the first word started with a ""B"". I'm about 60% sure that the directors were cult German brother-directors who've only done a few movies. <br/><br/>I think that the story was about a guy who went to some gentleman school or some sort of weird academy maybe? I remember it being super weird, but I really want to watch it haha.<br/><br/>I know that this sounds like it should be easy to search for, but I've seriously combed through all my messages online, my youtube history, and scoured Google. I am at a loss here.

It was, but also it sort of sticks with me (like it's been hours since I've seen it and I keep thinking about it). It's weird that a movie like this totally slipped me (I'm not familiar with the director at all). It's funny and it has a lot of sad moments. Same with Adaptation really, you can call it a comedy, even though it's much more than that. So, looking for movies that are like these two.";tt0268126|tt0449059;;funny|sad;;Comedy;;;

2izdkb;Psychological Sci-fi movies?;As strange as it sounds, I haven't finished a movie in like two years. Except Fight Club, that was amazing and probably my favourite movie ever. No matter what I try, most movies bore me after twenty minutes at most. So this is gonna be a weird request.<br/><br/>Those clichéd mainstream movies bore me to death, so instead of trying to watch what's new and hot, I wanna just try something that suits my taste. I love psychological stories, something that makes me question morality, decisions and views. Something that actually challenges the way I think about certain things. <br/><br/>And I love space. Space travel, exploration, the visuals - everything about it. Are there any movies that combine those two? Oh, and another important thing. If a movie has even the slightest of a jumpscare, I can't watch it. I'm dead serious. I'm cool with creepyness, but sudden loud noises and jumpscares in general just get to me way too much. So most of the horror genre already falls out.<br/><br/>Any suggestions for me? Actually, if you have a book in mind, I'd love to hear it too.<br/><br/>;tt0137523;;psychological;;Sci-Fi;Horror;;

2jhcwx;Looking to get into horror movies, where should I start?;I recently watched The Shining for the first time after refusing to watch it for years solely because it is a horror movie. I'd never liked the genre in the past (never had a bad experience with one, but something about bad acting and shitty plots always kept me from exploring the genre), but, of course, I really liked it, so now I'm looking for more. <br/><br/>My only requirement for a suggestion is that it needs to be at least partially well acted. The actors don't need to be Jack Nicholson, but bad acting can often pull me out of a film. Other then that though I'm up for anything, so bring them on! <br/><br/>;tt0081505;;;bad|acting;Horror;;;Jack Nicholson

30115v;[Request] Action movies that are so bad they're good;I need help finding a movie for Easter.  We celebrate non-traditional Easter with some friends - we eat non-traditional foods (like ribs or dim sum) and watch a really terrible movie.  Examples of movies we've watched include Running Man (1987), Maximum Overdrive (1986), and Zardoz (1974).  <br/><br/>The theme is sort of action movies with a sci-fi bend, preferably from the 70s or 80s.  Movies that have really ridiculous one-liners are the best.  I'm trying to avoid things that are too mainstream in hopes of finding something we haven't all seen already.  <br/><br/>Ideally I'm looking for something on Netflix so I don't have to put in tons of effort tracking it down, but I'm assuming there are tons of options.  I'm just hoping someone can think of a recommendation for something along these lines that they found really entertaining.<br/><br/>*Edit - thanks for all the good bad suggestions.  You guys are great.  I have a huge list of options for many years to come, assuming I don't binge watch all of these immediately!<br/>;tt0070948|tt0091499|tt0093894;;;;Action|Sci-Fi;;;

394rc3;Genuine thought provoking movies with a sentimental feeling. Examples 'Her' and 'Castaway';So let me say, I absolutely loved the movie Her. It hit me right in the feels in all the right ways, meaning making me think and ponder the sci-fi life of dating an artificial intelligence. The same for Castaway. While for me the movie itself didn't -really- start until after he returns from the island, the feelings, the sentiment of what he went through after returning, what it would be like, the empathy it made me have from multiple points of view. I seek other movies which have this same kind of combination, thought and feeling provoking without being just simply a outright romance. (Not that I have anything wrong with it, I love romance too!)<br/><br/>Let me know if you need more elaboration, though I'm not sure how else to explain myself. Similar movies I've liked without much of the romantic feeling vibe but a different indescribable feeling would be something like Fight Club, or the more recent Ex-Machina. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks in advance, looking forward to your suggestions!;tt0137523|tt0162222|tt0470752|tt1798709;;sentimental;;Romance|Sci-Fi;;;

Monsters are in a very iffy category and need to be truly horrifying to get me.<br/><br/>My SO would really like to watch a scary movie with me, but I don't want it to be one that is not only boring, but also terrible as a movie in itself. I really want him to enjoy it so that maybe he will be inclined to watch more with me.<br/><br/>He has stated that he is not interested in possession movies, but the other parameters I have set up are just fine. He's also said that it's difficult for him to find a movie scary if he doesn't like the characters. The less annoying they are, the better. He's also not a fan of convoluted plots, so something simple is best.<br/><br/>**EDIT**: Forgot to add, he hates unnecessary gore...<br/><br/>Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

As far as live-action goes, *The Turin Horse* is another great example.  Things like *Three Colors: Blue*, *Red Desert*, and *Ida* have too much romance/sex/kissing in varying degrees and edge on having too many characters.  <br/><br/>I'm very inexperienced with live-action film so far so anything that fits is worth a post.   <br/><br/>Thanks!";tt0058003|tt0108394|tt0208502|tt1316540;tt2718492;slow|films|minimal|dialogue|few|characters|prominent|female|character|the|live-action;;;Horror|Romance;;

4qb639;Mind-bending / Thought Provoking movies which explore concepts beyond human comprehension like Interstellar [Spoilers ahead];So, I finally saw Interstellar. Excellent movie.  I loved the concept and exploration of time manipulation through gravitational relativity. The imagining of the Singularity was so cool, the concept of the future humanity forcibly going back to adjust and shift time through a whole other dimensions to save ourselves. So cool.<br/><br/>I love stuff which twists your mind to has you think in different ways. My fondest example was Requiem for a Dream, probably near to top for some of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Movies with similar exploration of concepts: Her (The points in which she becomes more and more human, eventually transcending human flaws and integrating into the hivemind), Exam ( The suspense and thought provokation of figuring out the rules and who will actually escape ), Cloud Atlas (a pretty good example of exploration of time as a whole all around), and What Dreams May Come (The concept of life after death). <br/><br/>Others which I respect but didn't fully enjoy: Mr Nobody.<br/><br/>There's one other major one I'm forgetting, but I'd love things which explore concepts beyond our preception, or simply excellent at working your mind to combine the story. <br/><br/>That being said - Anything related to Cop-drama can be left out, such as Se7en.<br/><br/>Edit: The Truman Show is actually another great more lighthearted concept I also enjoyed.;tt0114369|tt0120382|tt0120889|tt0180093|tt0816692|tt1258197|tt1798709;tt0485947;mind-bending|thought|provoking;cop-drama;;;;

4sb9a5;Which films feature well, defined characters with interesting problems in engaging contexts that could possibly be solved through the design of a mobile application? Details inside!;I am a lecturer at a design institute. This module my students are required to design a mobile application tailored specifically for a character in a film. I need to supply a list of suggested films from which the students can choose. The mobile application should ideally help to solve a problem that the character is encountering in the film. It can be slightly fantastical - the aim is kind of to ask WHAT IF these characters had a mobile app specifically designed for their problem. The problems could be personal, social, cultural or psychological. I have a couple of ideas but i was wondering if you guys might have some interesting suggestions.<br/><br/>For instance: Memento is a good example. The character has a clearly defined problem (memory issues) and an objective.

So often I feel like movies in this sort of vein, with the protagonists trying to uncover a mystery/scandal, ends up manufacturing tension and drama because everyone has a hidden agenda and the characters have to fight their battles within and not just outside - so to speak. Everyone was on the same team, as they rightly should be, and I really liked that. It really showcased the work rather than the events. Instead of getting bogged down by all the victims and the tragedy and stuff, it focused on journalists doing their jobs, and doing it well.<br/><br/>So anyways, recommend me some movies about journalists/detectives/whoever working on investigations like that.";tt1895587;;investigative|journalism|everyone|working|the|tension|and|on|journalists|detectives;;Drama;;;

5f0tug;[LIST] Coming-of-age dramas FFO The Perks of Being a Wallflower, 500 Days of Summer, It's Kind of a Funny Story, etc.;I thought I'd make a list of movies that I feel fit under this umbrella of somewhat-romantic dramas, occasionally comedic, coming-of-age films that aren't chick flicks (that may or may not involve teens), especially since they end up being a common request. A lot of these deal with issues like loneliness, depression, and finding your place in the world. These are roughly in chronological order by release date, but I won't put a movie on here if I didn't enjoy it myself. I'll make another list below this one comprised of what gets recommended in the comments.

I am a very avid movie watcher so I constantly look out for ""different"" movies and really appreciate out of the box movies, if only for creativity. I also like really goofy movies, like Shaun of the Dead and Tucker and Dale VS Evil, which he can only get into 50% of the time. <br/><br/>He on the other hand LOVES war movies and bad action films with 0 plot. I try to watch them, but I just really don't like war movies unless they rip out your soul and produce copious amounts of tears (see The Pianist). I can dig a good action movie, but I need plot and human emotion involved. The Green Room was an action movie we both enjoyed. <br/><br/>PS We both like anime, but he's pretty new to it.

They are set in the world we all now - but somehow it's not the world that we know because it has some weird rules that the film still just takes as a given, as if they were normal.  <br/>  <br/>I think Being John Malkovich is the best example of what I'm looking for (have seen all Charlie Kaufman movies by the way). The world looks just like ours. The people look just like we do. But they all behave in such strange ways, like people would never act in real life. But in the context of the film it all makes sense.  <br/>  <br/>I really don't know how to describe it, because that's what I'm looking for.

670yjv;Movies set in a ever-so-slightly different world?;An odd request, but I've happened across a few of these and they've managed to become favorites. I'm thinking things like TiMER, District 9 and The Invention of Lying where the world has just a single, fundamentally unrealistic change that affects the whole dynamic of the world and creates a type of drama that could only occur in such a setting.<br/><br/>In TiMER, we all have a soulmate countdown clock that tells when you'll meet your perfect match. Some don't know because their match hasn't installed the timer, some won't meet theirs for a decade or more, and this knowledge gives everyone a unique perspective and attitude. In Invention of Lying, nobody has ever been able to lie, until one man suddenly becomes able, thus creating all manner of problems that are utterly hilarious and entertaining, but could only be possible in this kind of setting. District 9 is a film set as if it was in the real world, but alien life is not only confirmed, but widely known, accepted and treated in a very racist/xenophobic manner, complete with a bunch of hapless bureaucrats who check in on them like they were just casual parole officers. <br/><br/>It's an odd and kind of specific request, but I'd love to see more in this charming sub-genre. I hope I've explained what I'm looking for well enough, because it's a hard thing to quantify, but hopefully there are some people here who know what I'm talking about and also know some great indie/under-the-radar stuff that I've missed.;tt1058017|tt1136608|tt1179794;;ever-so-slightly|different|world;;;;;

6awsnu;Movies that are actually thought-provoking and surprising, that don't give away the ending?;"I'm sick of generic (mostly action) movies where the ending is painfully obvious within the first half hour of the movie; I just stop giving a shit when I know how it's going to end anyways. I'll list of some examples of movies I've really liked because they were thought-provoking or unpredictable, and I'll list some examples of movies that I just couldn't stand, that I want to steer away from. <br/><br/>**Movies that I really enjoyed**:<br/><br/>* *Inception (2010)* - Yes, you could argue that the ending was obvious the whole time, you kind of knew that their mission was going to succeed in the end, but there was SO much more that was being unraveled and revealed along the way.<br/><br/>* *Interstellar (2014)* - Absolutely amazing, I loved how it was presented. I had zero idea how it was going to end the whole way through.<br/><br/>* *The Sixth Sense (1999)* - This one should go without saying. I never saw it coming.<br/><br/>* *Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)* - Amazing soundtrack the whole way through, hilarious, and I had no idea what direction it would take next, the whole way through.<br/><br/>* *The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)* - Now again, with this one, you could TECHNICALLY make the argument that you know how it's going to end during a lot of the movie. But the way time jumps around, and not knowing what else will happen, kind of makes that irrelevant in the case of this movie.<br/><br/>* *The Hateful Eight (2015)* - Probably the best example I can think of. I legitimately wish I could wipe my memory of this movie, just so I could enjoy seeing it for the first time again, and being surprised and delighted by all the twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.<br/><br/>**Movies I couldn't stand, for context**:<br/><br/>* *Dredd (2012)* - I thought the concept was great, and had a lot of potential. But then as soon as they got locked inside the ""city"" and the crime boss announced that everyone would be hunting them, I knew how it was going to end. They'd run around aimlessly, have a few close calls, a few miraculous escapes, and then somehow, against all odds, defeat the big boss and make their escape. I turned it off after 10 minutes of that.<br/><br/>* *John Wick (2014)* - I found this to be about as unoriginal as action movies can get. Going into the movie, you already know the entire thing is going to consist of this amazingly skilled killer running around the city, somehow overcoming everyone who's out to kill him, just to defeat the bad guy and save the day at the last minute. I think I quit watching this one within the first 20 minutes. <br/><br/>Anyways, I hope that's enough background on the kind of movie suggestions I'm looking for. I have a lot of downtime to fill at night, so I will probably be watching most, if not all, of your suggestions.

6kapt6;Movies That Explore Broken People with Anger Issues;So, I'm currently going through something in my life right now, and since I've known for a fact that movies have helped people overcome emotional obstacles in their life and helped them feel better about themselves, I was hoping someone could help me do the same here.<br/><br/>I recently lost some precious friends due to my outburst of anger. My temper has always been a problem of mine, and I've been feeling depressed about these friends over the past few days, feeling bad about myself. So I was hoping I could find some films about broken people who are flawed like me and see how they overcome their insecurities and anti-social nature to fit into society or whatever.<br/><br/>An example I could think of is **Young Adult** starring Charlize Theron. Yes, Mavis didn't technically resolve her issues with her highschool sweetheart by the end of the movie, but I think it still fits because there's just something affirming when you see a flawed character like that who doesn't change, as if the film is telling you it's normal for you to be as flawed as you are, because that's just how people are.<br/><br/>That said, I'll leave it to your discretion what kind of film you think would help me feel better about my anger issues and my trouble dealing with people. Movies about angry people dealing with those anger issues would be really appreciated, because most recommendations I searched online just led me to plots where the anger is merely a superficial personality of the main character rather than the central plot. **Punch-Drunk Love** seems to be another good example where the MC deals with his anger issues (I haven't watched it though, so I'm hoping you could inform me how relevant this movie is to the issue).<br/><br/>And no, please don't recommend me **Anger Management**. :P That movie doesn't take anger issues seriously. Thanks a lot for your help. I really hope you could help me out.;tt0272338|tt1625346;tt0305224;anti-social;;;;Charlize Theron;

It's just a really creepy weird head fucky film, probably favourite horror.<br/><br/>So yeah any suggestions for films I may like based on this, films that get in your head and make you think or just freak you the fuck out;tt2321549|tt2428170|tt3086442|tt3170832;;psychological|horrors|mind|fuckers|thought|provokers;;Thriller;;;

w8pdm;Movies with rain.;I ask because at the moment where I live it there has been torrential rain. Even weather forecasters say that there is no end in sight to these rainy outbursts, which are causing pretty severe flooding in some areas. Also I thought it might be a question that requires a bit more thought than 'Films like Moon' or whatever.<br/><br/>So. Films not just where there might be one affectationally rainy scene, but films where rain is a vital part of creating the atmosphere. I'm thinking films like Blade Runner in which the prejudicial smothering rain has a symbolic meaning. If you want, you could mention films where other kinds of weather are used to the same effect. Honestly I thought it might just be an interesting thing to discuss really.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for your time. :);tt0083658|tt1182345;;rain;;;;;

xhpp6;[Request] Sad, emotional, depressing movies with a good ending?;Doesn't HAVE to be a good ending, I'm just looking for generally sad movies. I don't know of many movies that are like this but here are some:<br/><br/><br/>Sad/depressing/emotional but with a good ending:<br/><br/>* Groundhog Day<br/><br/>* Click<br/> <br/>* Mr. Nobody <br/> <br/>Sad in general:<br/><br/>* Saving Private Ryan <br/> <br/>* The Butterfly Effect;tt0107048|tt0120815|tt0289879|tt0389860|tt0485947;;sad|emotional|depressing;;;;;
xwrru;[Request] Movies set in small towns.;I recently watched Super 8. I really liked it, but honestly, the parts I enjoyed the most were in the first half of the movie. A group of friends in their small town, sneaking out, going to each other's houses and other things. I don't know why, but I really like that in movies!<br/>I'm looking for movies about groups of friends - kids/teenagers, to be a bit more specific - just... In their small town. Dealing with larger things or even just normal teenage stuff (the latter is preferred actually).<br/>I realise this is quite a specific niche, kind of a subgenre of Coming-Of-Age, but I'd be greatful for anything anyone knows about! Oh, and if you even have something just involving a group of teenage friends, I'm up for that, too!  <br/>  <br/>EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the suggestions, guys! I've got enough movies to keep me going for a while, now.;tt1650062;;small|towns|set|in|coming-of-age;;;;;

yuzcs;I need some horror movies, folks.;A friend of mine has decided to have a horror movie marathon, and I have no idea why. This girl was terrified by *The Woman in Black*. So, if you lovely folk could give me a list of some horror, that would be fantastic. It could be gore, psychological, so-bad-it's-funny, or anything that caught your fancy. Thanks!<br/><br/>*edit* - Personally, I enjoy the scariest things you an find. I feel like putting my friend through hell because she decided to scare herself.

zcdnl;Looking for great,moving Dramas;I know that's a broad request so let me elaborate. What I am in the mood for watching would be anything that really packs a strong emotional punch whether it be uplifting, bittersweet or abysmally bleak. Something that resonates with the heart and has real human qualities whether it portrays the best or worst of our condition, not mindless action (although I do enjoy mindless action too). I've been very lazy in relation to watching movies this past year so that's why I've made this post. Some films that I like that I consider to fall under this banner would include Amores Perros and 21 gramms, Cinema Paradiso (not the director's cut) The Deer Hunter, Schindler's list,  etc. Relevant suggestions are welcome.;tt0077416|tt0095765|tt0108052|tt0245712|tt0315733;;;;Drama;;;
