The films had to be ones which I had never seen before and so I began to compile a list. But it wasn't quite interesting enough. It was failing to entice me.

NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE The list below is the result of much refinement and revision. A little under two years, I'd wager. I am now asking reddit to help me refine the list a little more.

NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE To the question: NEW_LINE My long time girlfriend has a lot of intimacy issues we're working out. Our next step is trying to be more sexual. We like to watch movies during the weekends, where comedy (almost every kind) is our favorite, but we would like to watch something with more sexual content. The reason why we would like the sexual content, is to think more about sex -  both as to get a reminder and hopefully to get a bit aroused.  NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE We don't like fantasy movies with magic, sword combat, orcs and dragons or any kind of Sci- Fi at all. She loved the Twilight movies and books, so vampire stuff works. Negative kind of sexual content is also a HUGE NO- NO -  like rape, molestation or even someone clearly getting pressured into something. Comedies are preffered, but almost every genre works. We would like to avoid very sad movies, unless they are really worth watching. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE The more sexual content, the better. It doesn't have to be grafic, but seeing some skin and sex scenes wouldn't exactly be a bad thing. The acting and plot should at least be watchable as in terms of quality. A bad direct- to- DVD movie with the only intention to show some nipples, isn't exactly the thing we're looking for. Although ""high school comedies"" is something my GF enjoys, so we're not that picky. We're not looking for Oscar winners, we want to get entertained and get it the mood at the same time.

670yjv,"Movies set in a ever- so- slightly different world? An odd request, but I've happened across a few of these and they've managed to become favorites. I'm thinking things like TiMER, District 9 and The Invention of Lying where the world has just a single, fundamentally unrealistic change that affects the whole dynamic of the world and creates a type of drama that could only occur in such a setting. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE In TiMER, we all have a soulmate countdown clock that tells when you'll meet your perfect match. Some don't know because their match hasn't installed the timer, some won't meet theirs for a decade or more, and this knowledge gives everyone a unique perspective and attitude. In Invention of Lying, nobody has ever been able to lie, until one man suddenly becomes able, thus creating all manner of problems that are utterly hilarious and entertaining, but could only be possible in this kind of setting. District 9 is a film set as if it was in the real world, but alien life is not only confirmed, but widely known, accepted and treated in a very racist/ xenophobic manner, complete with a bunch of hapless bureaucrats who check in on them like they were just casual parole officers.  NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE It's an odd and kind of specific request, but I'd love to see more in this charming sub- genre.

I'm sick of generic (mostly action) movies where the ending is painfully obvious within the first half hour of the movie; I just stop giving a shit when I know how it's going to end anyways. I'll list of some examples of movies I've really liked because they were thought- provoking or unpredictable, and I'll list some examples of movies that I just couldn't stand, that I want to steer away from.  NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE **Movies that I really enjoyed**: NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *Inception (2010)* -  Yes, you could argue that the ending was obvious the whole time, you kind of knew that their mission was going to succeed in the end, but there was SO much more that was being unraveled and revealed along the way. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *Interstellar (2014)* -  Absolutely amazing, I loved how it was presented. I had zero idea how it was going to end the whole way through. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *The Sixth Sense (1999)* -  This one should go without saying. I never saw it coming. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)* -  Amazing soundtrack the whole way through, hilarious, and I had no idea what direction it would take next, the whole way through. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)* -  Now again, with this one, you could TECHNICALLY make the argument that you know how it's going to end during a lot of the movie. But the way time jumps around, and not knowing what else will happen, kind of makes that irrelevant in the case of this movie. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *The Hateful Eight (2015)* -  Probably the best example I can think of. I legitimately wish I could wipe my memory of this movie, just so I could enjoy seeing it for the first time again, and being surprised and delighted by all the twists and turns. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE **Movies I couldn't stand, for context**: NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *Dredd (2012)* -  I thought the concept was great, and had a lot of potential. But then as soon as they got locked inside the ""city"" and the crime boss announced that everyone would be hunting them, I knew how it was going to end. They'd run around aimlessly, have a few close calls, a few miraculous escapes, and then somehow, against all odds, defeat the big boss and make their escape. I turned it off after 10 minutes of that. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE * *John Wick (2014)* -  I found this to be about as unoriginal as action movies can get. Going into the movie, you already know the entire thing is going to consist of this amazingly skilled killer running around the city, somehow overcoming everyone who's out to kill him, just to defeat the bad guy and save the day at the last minute. I think I quit watching this one within the first 20 minutes.  NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE Anyways, I hope that's enough background on the kind of movie suggestions I'm looking for.

6kapt6,"Movies That Explore Broken People with Anger Issues So, I'm currently going through something in my life right now, and since I've known for a fact that movies have helped people overcome emotional obstacles in their life and helped them feel better about themselves, I was hoping someone could help me do the same here. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE I recently lost some precious friends due to my outburst of anger. My temper has always been a problem of mine, and I've been feeling depressed about these friends over the past few days, feeling bad about myself. So I was hoping I could find some films about broken people who are flawed like me and see how they overcome their insecurities and anti- social nature to fit into society or whatever. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE An example I could think of is **Young Adult** starring Charlize Theron. Yes, Mavis didn't technically resolve her issues with her highschool sweetheart by the end of the movie, but I think it still fits because there's just something affirming when you see a flawed character like that who doesn't change, as if the film is telling you it's normal for you to be as flawed as you are, because that's just how people are. NEW_LINE  NEW_LINE That said, I'll leave it to your discretion what kind of film you think would help me feel better about my anger issues and my trouble dealing with people. Movies about angry people dealing with those anger issues would be really appreciated, because most recommendations I searched online just led me to plots where the anger is merely a superficial personality of the main character rather than the central plot. **Punch- Drunk Love** seems to be another good example where the MC deals with his anger issues (I haven't watched it though, so I'm hoping you could inform me how relevant this movie is to the issue).
